# Do Something Awesome Competiton

ACM is hosting a competition for engineering students to build something awesome. 
You will have 4 weeks to build that something. 
There are not too many strict rules on what this has to be, so feel free to do whatever interests you.

The competition will end on Dec 3, 2014 at 7pm.

## The Prize
* Raspberry Pi for each member of the team.
* Your names will be put on a plaque to be displayed somewhere in Benton.

## Signing Up
Send an email to Kyle Rogers with your group members. 
If you have a project idea already, include that as well. 
Also, include if you plan on using any hardware for your project.


## The Rules

* Must be software based. If there is a hardware component as well, that is ok, however, the bulk of the work must be software (we are the computer science group, after all). 
So feel free to use an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. 
	* Ex: Building a maze solving robot has a significant hardware component, however, the interesting component will be how you utilize graph search algorithms to find a path.
* The source code must be hosted on GitHub
* You will work in teams of 2-4. If you choose to go at it alone, that is fine, but you will have to work extra hard.
* You should use at least 1 of the technologies that we have covered in the workshops. That means:
	* Linux. Anything related to Linux. Just developing in a Linux command-line environment is fine, but this typically means you will be using a command-line editors such as Emacs and Vim. Note that developing in Mac does **NOT** count!
	* Git. Use Git to manage your code individually or with your team. Branching and using Git on a team would be preferred, but not required. However, we *will* be expecting good commit logs (e.g. descriptive commit messages, commits in appropriate-sized chunks).
	* Emacs. Not just use Emacs, however, as we could never actually verify this... This would essentially have to be a plugin
	* Python. Simply doing your project in Python is good enough for this
	* Django. Obviously uses Python, so kudos to you if you also use Django
	* HTML 5. Fairly self-explanatory
	* If you don’t want to do any of these, that’s fine, but it better be *really* awesome…
* The project must have been built for this competition. You may not submit anything that you are building/have built for another class or another organization
	
## Turning It In
The competition will end on December 3, 2014 at the start of the ACM meeting. 
Your code must be committed to GitHub with a release published. 
If your code requires compilation, you must have a Make file or instructions on how to compile.

You will be expected to demo your project. The judges may also play with your project. 
	
## Judging
Judges will be a combination of professors and students. 

You will be judged according to how awesome your project is with respect to your skill level. 
ie a freshman with only 174 experience should not be a significant disadvantage to a senior. 

## Help
Kyle Rogers will be available to help with any problems that you may have about your project. 
Both with developing an idea as well as bugs you may encounter while building. 
Send an email or come to the weekly ACM meeting to discuss any problems you may be having.
